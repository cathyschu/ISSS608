# Beyond ggplot2 Fundamentals

## [2.1]{style="color:skyblue"} Overview

Several **ggplot2 extensions** for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. By the end of this exercise, one will be able to:

-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in **ggrepel** package.
-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in **ggthemes** and **hrbrthemes** packages; and
-   plot composite figure by combing ggplot2 graphs by using **patchwork** package.

## [2.2]{style="color:skyblue"} Getting started

### [2.2.1]{style="color:skyblue"} Installing and loading the required libraries

In this exercise, besides **tidyverse**, four R packages will be used.

They are:

1.  **ggrepel:** a R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.
2.  **ggthemes:** a R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ggplot.
3.  **hrbrthemes**: a R package provides typographu-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.
4.  **patchwork:** a R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

Code chunk below will be used to **check** if these packages have been installed and **also load them** onto the working R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork,
               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,
               tidyverse) #all packages are then installed.
```

### [2.2.2]{style="color:skyblue"} Importing data

For the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.

The code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package. **readr** is one of the tidyversepackage.

```{r}
library(readr)
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

There are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.

-   The categorical attributes are ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.
-   The continuous attributes are MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

## [2.3]{style="color:skyblue"} Beyond ggplot Annotation: ggrepel

One of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.

## Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS,
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,
              linewidth=0.5) +
  geom_label(aes(label = ID),
             hjust = .5,
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

## Code

``` r
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS,
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,
              linewidth=0.5) +
  geom_label(aes(label = ID),
             hjust = .5,
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

## 🦖 Practice

🦖 **Used colours to differentiate genders.**

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS,
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,
              linewidth=0.5) +
  geom_label(aes(label = ID,
                 colour = GENDER), #added colours
             hjust = .5,
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```
:::

[**ggrepel**](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/) ![](/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex03/images/ggrepel_logo.jpg){width="40"} is an extension of **ggplot2** package which provides `geoms` for **ggplot2** to repel overlapping text as in the examples below.

![](/Hands-on_Ex/Hands-on_Ex03/images/ggrepel.jpg){fig-align="center" width="700"}

We simply replace `geom_text()` by [`geom_text_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html) and `geom_label()` with [`geom_label_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html).

## [2.4]{style="color:skyblue"} Beyond ggplot2 Themes

ggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes. They are:

`theme_gray()`, `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_dark()`, `theme_light()`, `theme_linedraw()`, `theme_minimal()`, `theme_void()`.

::: panel-tabset
## Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 boundary = 100,
                 color = "grey25",
                 fill = "grey90") +
  theme_gray() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")


```

## Code

```{.r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 boundary = 100,
                 color = "grey25",
                 fill = "grey90") +
  theme_gray() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

## 🦖  Practice I

🦖 Applied `theme_light()` and different colors for fill and color.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 boundary = 100,
                 color = "grey90",
                 fill = "pink") +
  theme_light() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

## 🦖  Practice II 

🦖 Applied `theme_dark()` and different colors for fill and color.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 boundary = 100,
                 color = "grey90",
                 fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_dark() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
