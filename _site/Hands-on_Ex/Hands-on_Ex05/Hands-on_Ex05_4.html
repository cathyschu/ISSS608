<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">1 Overview</h2>
<p>Parallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.</p>

<p>parallelPlot is an R package specially designed to plot a parallel coordinates plot by using ‘htmlwidgets’ package and d3.js. We will learn how to use functions provided in <strong>parallelPlot</strong> package to build <strong>interactive</strong> parallel coordinates plot.</p>
