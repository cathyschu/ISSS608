In this hands-on exercise, I will create animated data visualisation with gganimate and plotly r packages.

Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames - like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregated data.The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualisation.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore starting making animated graphs, think of the question first:\nDoes it make sense to go through the effort?\nIf you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, an animated graphic may not be worth the time investment.

It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how to positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young,\n                      size = Population,\n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7,\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2,12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}',\n       x = '% Aged',\n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, - transition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year) - ease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics.

    "text": "Visualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In Session 1, there are some of the popular statustistical graphics methods for visualising distribution, such as histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot, and how they can be created using ggplot2.\nIn this session, we will learn two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualisaing distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following R packages will be used for this exercise.\n\nggridges: a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots\nggdist: a ggplot2 extension specially designed for visualising distribution and uncertainty.\ntidyverse: a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs\nggthemes: a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package.\ncolorspace: a R pckage provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colours or colour palettes, manipulating these colours, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used loading these R pakcages into RStudio environment.\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes, colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\n\n🦄 WHAT FOR\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than ~6 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English scores by class.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 2.5,\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = \"Class\", expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, we will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot ridgeline plots. They are:\ngrom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n🦖 PracticeExample plot\n\n\n🦖 Changed colour fill, opacity, no grid lines and scale.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 5,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"pink\", 0.5),\n    color = \"#7097BB\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = \"Class\", expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges(grid = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid colour but rather with colours that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient().\nBoth geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges()\n\n🦖 PracticeExample plot\n\n\n🦖 Applied a different filling colour scheme.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional boxplot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race.

    "text": "Ridgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\n\n🦄 WHAT FOR\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than ~6 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English scores by class.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 2.5,\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = \"Class\", expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, we will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot ridgeline plots. They are:\ngrom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n🦖 PracticeExample plot\n\n\n🦖 Changed colour fill, opacity, no grid lines and scale.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 5,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"pink\", 0.5),\n    color = \"#7097BB\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = \"Class\", expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges(grid = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid colour but rather with colours that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient().\nBoth geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges()\n\n🦖 PracticeExample plot\n\n\n🦖 Applied a different filling colour scheme.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n🦖 PracticeExample Plot\n\n\n🦖 Changed slab colour, fill, linetype to dotline, slab alpha, and added color to the boxplot. Outliers are shown as well.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               slab_color = \"black\",\n               slab_fill = \"pink\",\n               slab_linetype = \"dashed\",\n               slab_linewidth = 0.3,\n               slab_alpha = 0.4,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               col = \"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = \"left\" to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nPracticeExample Plot\n\n\n🦖 Changed stat_dots color by CLASS\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               slab_color = \"black\",\n               slab_fill = \"grey\",\n               slab_linetype = \"dashed\",\n               slab_linewidth = 0.3,\n               slab_alpha = 0.4,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               col = \"grey\",\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\",\n            justification = 1.2,\n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2,\n            aes(color = CLASS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\",\n            justification = 1.2,\n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, coord_flit() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance.

For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the [APA](https://my.ilstu.edu/~jhkahn/apastats.html) gold standard for statistical reporting. \nFor example, here are results from a robust t-test:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, ggstatsplot and tidyverse will be used.\n\npacman::p_load(ggstatsplot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDIY\n\n\n\nImport Exam-csv data by using appropriate tidyverse package.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, gghistostats() is used to build an visual of one-sample test on English scores.\n\n\nShow the code\nset.seed(1234)\n\ngghistostats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"bayes\",\n  test.value = 60,\n  xlab = \"English scores\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault information:\nstatistical details / Bayes Factor / sample sizes / distribution summary\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes factor is the ratio of the likelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another. It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favour of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favour of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favour of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\frac{likelihood-of-data-given-H_1}{likelihood-of-data-given-H_0} = \\frac{P(D|H_1)}{P(D/H_0)}\n\\]\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough estimation of the Bayes factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.\nOne of the most common interpretation is this one - first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagemakers in 2013.\n\nBayes Factor\n\n\nIF B10 IS…\nTHEN YOU HAVE\n\n\n\n\n&gt;100\nExtreme evidence for H1\n\n\n30 - 100\nVery strong evidence for H1\n\n\n10 - 30\nStrong evidence for H1\n\n\n3 - 10\nModerate evidence for H1\n\n\n1 - 3\nAnecdotal evidence for H1\n\n\n1\nNo evidence\n\n\n1/3 - 1\nAnecdotal evidence for H1\n\n\n1/3 - 1/10\nModerate evidence for H1\n\n\n1/10 - 1/30\nStrong evidence for H1\n\n\n1/30 - 1/100\nVery Strong evidence for H1\n\n\n&lt;1/100\nExtreme evidence for H1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER,\n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  message = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault information: statistical details / Bayes factor / samples sizes / distribution summary\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English scores by race.\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE,\n  pariwise.comparisons = TRUE,\n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.methods = \"fdr\",\n  message = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“na” -&gt; only non-significant\n“s” -&gt; only significant\n“all” -&gt; everything\n\n\n\n\nTestCISummary\n\n\nFollowing (between-subjects) tests are carried out for each type of analyses.\n\n\n\nTYPE\nNO.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favour of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favour of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favour of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\frac{likelihood-of-data-given-H_1}{likelihood-of-data-given-H_0} = \\frac{P(D|H_1)}{P(D/H_0)}\n\\]\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough estimation of the Bayes factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.\nOne of the most common interpretation is this one - first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagemakers in 2013.\n\nBayes Factor\n\n\nIF B10 IS…\nTHEN YOU HAVE\n\n\n\n\n&gt;100\nExtreme evidence for H1\n\n\n30 - 100\nVery strong evidence for H1\n\n\n10 - 30\nStrong evidence for H1\n\n\n3 - 10\nModerate evidence for H1\n\n\n1 - 3\nAnecdotal evidence for H1\n\n\n1\nNo evidence\n\n\n1/3 - 1\nAnecdotal evidence for H1\n\n\n1/3 - 1/10\nModerate evidence for H1\n\n\n1/10 - 1/30\nStrong evidence for H1\n\n\n1/30 - 1/100\nVery Strong evidence for H1\n\n\n&lt;1/100\nExtreme evidence for H1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER,\n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  message = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault information: statistical details / Bayes factor / samples sizes / distribution summary\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English scores by race.\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE,\n  pariwise.comparisons = TRUE,\n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.methods = \"fdr\",\n  message = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“na” -&gt; only non-significant\n“s” -&gt; only significant\n“all” -&gt; everything\n\n\n\n\nTestCISummary\n\n\nFollowing (between-subjects) tests are carried out for each type of analyses.\n\n\n\nTYPE\nNO.

The extension called patchwork is specially designed for combining separate ggplot 2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here is the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-column layout using the Plus sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-row layout using the Division design /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a a composite of two histograms created using patchwork.

For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using: - “/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs - “|” operator to place the plots beside each other - “()” operator to define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n🦖 Practice I🦖 Practice IIPlotCode\n\n\n🦖 Changed the layout.\n\np3 | ( p2 / p1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🦖 Used theme_economist()\n\npatchwork &lt;- p3 | (p2 / p1)\npatchwork & theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1)),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n🦄 Learn more with Plot Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n🦖 PracticePlotCode\n\n\n🦖 Changed level tag and used a new theme theme_stata()\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A') + \n  theme_stata()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout.
