Figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2.\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: Hadley Wickham (2010) “A layered grammar of graphics.” Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 3–28.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nA short description of each building blocks:\n\nData: the dataset being plotted.\nAesthetic: takes attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: the visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets: split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics: statistical transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems: define the plan on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes: modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-axis title, or legend background."

The extension called patchwork is specially designed for combining separate ggplot 2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here is the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-column layout using the Plus sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-row layout using the Division design /\n\n\n\n\nFigure in the tabset below shows a a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Code is pretty simple.\n\n🦖 PracticePlotCode\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- p1 + p2\npatchwork & theme_stata()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using: - “/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs - “|” operator to place the plots beside each other - “()” operator to define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n🦖 Practice I🦖 Practice IIPlotCode\n\n\n🦖 Changed the layout.\n\np3 | ( p2 / p1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🦖 Used theme_economist()\n\npatchwork &lt;- p3 | (p2 / p1)\npatchwork & theme_economist() +\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = rel(1)),\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 8))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n🦄 Learn more with Plot Assembly.\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n🦖 PracticePlotCode\n\n\n🦖 Changed level tag and used a new theme theme_stata()\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A') + \n  theme_stata()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) +\n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, I will create animated data visualisation with gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, I will learn how to 1/ reshape data by using tidyr package, and 2/ process, wrangle and transform datawith dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames - like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregated data.The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualisation.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore starting making animated graphs, think of the question first:\nDoes it make sense to go through the effort?\nIf you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, an animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly: R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate: a ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski: converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminer: an excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse: a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\nWrite a code chunk to import Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook by using appropriate R package from tidyverse family.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      shee=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nread_xls of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\nmutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, mutate_each_() was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0 and funs() was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0. In view of this, we will re-write the code by using mutate_at() show in the code chunk below.\n\n\n❓ mutate_at() links back to the same page in textbook?\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet = \"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\nInstead of using mutate_at(), across() can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet = \"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how to positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young,\n                      size = Population,\n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7,\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2,12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}',\n       x = '% Aged',\n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, - transition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year) - ease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, I will create animated data visualisation with gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, I will learn how to 1/ reshape data by using tidyr package, and 2/ process, wrangle and transform datawith dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames - like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregated data.The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualisation.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore starting making animated graphs, think of the question first:\nDoes it make sense to go through the effort?\nIf you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, an animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

    "text": "Visualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In Session 1, there are some of the popular statustistical graphics methods for visualising distribution, such as histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot, and how they can be created using ggplot2.\nIn this session, we will learn two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualisaing distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following R packages will be used for this exercise.\n\nggridges: a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots\nggdist: a ggplot2 extension specially designed for visualising distribution and uncertainty.\ntidyverse: a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs\nggthemes: a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package.\ncolorspace: a R pckage provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colours or colour palettes, manipulating these colours, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used loading these R pakcages into RStudio environment.\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes, colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\n\n🦄 WHAT FOR\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than ~6 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English scores by class.\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 2.5,\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = \"Class\", expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, we will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot ridgeline plots. They are:\ngrom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n🦖 PracticeExample plotExample code\n\n\n🦖 Changed colour fill, opacity, no grid lines and scale.\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 5,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"pink\", 0.5),\n    color = \"#7097BB\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = \"Class\", expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges(grid = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid colour but rather with colours that vary in some form along the x axis.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional boxplot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualisation, which contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\n🦖 PracticeExample PlotExample Code\n\n\n🦖 With slab interval; changed color for the slab & interval, points.\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               slab_color = \"black\",\n               slab_fill = \"pink\",\n               slab_linetype = \"dashed\",\n               slab_linewidth = 0.3,\n               slab_alpha = 0.6,\n               interval_colour = \"skyblue\",\n               point_fill = \"yellow\",\n               point_colour = \"red\",\n               point_size = 2\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from code above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n🦖 PracticeExample PlotExample Code\n\n\n🦖 Changed slab colour, fill, linetype to dotline, slab alpha, and added color to the boxplot. Outliers are shown as well.\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               slab_color = \"black\",\n               slab_fill = \"pink\",\n               slab_linetype = \"dashed\",\n               slab_linewidth = 0.3,\n               slab_alpha = 0.4,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               col = \"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = \"left\" to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nPracticeExample PlotExample Code\n\n\n🦖 Changed stat_dots color by CLASS\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               slab_color = \"black\",\n               slab_fill = \"grey\",\n               slab_linetype = \"dashed\",\n               slab_linewidth = 0.3,\n               slab_alpha = 0.4,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               col = \"grey\",\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\",\n            justification = 1.2,\n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2,\n            aes(color = CLASS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\",\n            justification = 1.2,\n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, coord_flit() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nPracticeExample PlotExample Code\n\n\nUsed a different theme theme_stata() and changed colours for the slab and dots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🕵️ Notice the there are fewer dots when using colours to display CLASS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\",\n            justification = 1.2,\n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\n🎯 Claus O.

    "text": "Ridgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\n\n🦄 WHAT FOR\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than ~6 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English scores by class.\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 2.5,\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0,0),\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = \"Class\", expand = expansion(add=c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R.

They are:\ngrom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges().

    "text": "Raincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional boxplot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualisation, which contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\n🦖 PracticeExample PlotExample Code\n\n\n🦖 With slab interval; changed color for the slab & interval, points.\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               slab_color = \"black\",\n               slab_fill = \"pink\",\n               slab_linetype = \"dashed\",\n               slab_linewidth = 0.3,\n               slab_alpha = 0.6,\n               interval_colour = \"skyblue\",\n               point_fill = \"yellow\",\n               point_colour = \"red\",\n               point_size = 2\n) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from code above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n🦖 PracticeExample PlotExample Code\n\n\n🦖 Changed slab colour, fill, linetype to dotline, slab alpha, and added color to the boxplot. Outliers are shown as well.\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               slab_color = \"black\",\n               slab_fill = \"pink\",\n               slab_linetype = \"dashed\",\n               slab_linewidth = 0.3,\n               slab_alpha = 0.4,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               col = \"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin.

At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nPracticeExample PlotExample Code\n\n\nUsed a different theme theme_stata() and changed colours for the slab and dots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🕵️ Notice the there are fewer dots when using colours to display CLASS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\",\n            justification = 1.2,\n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\n🎯 Claus O.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favour of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favour of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favour of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\frac{likelihood-of-data-given-H_1}{likelihood-of-data-given-H_0} = \\frac{P(D|H_1)}{P(D/H_0)}\n\\]\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough estimation of the Bayes factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.\nOne of the most common interpretation is this one - first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagemakers in 2013.\n\nBayes Factor\n\n\nIF B10 IS…\nTHEN YOU HAVE\n\n\n\n\n&gt;100\nExtreme evidence for H1\n\n\n30 - 100\nVery strong evidence for H1\n\n\n10 - 30\nStrong evidence for H1\n\n\n3 - 10\nModerate evidence for H1\n\n\n1 - 3\nAnecdotal evidence for H1\n\n\n1\nNo evidence\n\n\n1/3 - 1\nAnecdotal evidence for H1\n\n\n1/3 - 1/10\nModerate evidence for H1\n\n\n1/10 - 1/30\nStrong evidence for H1\n\n\n1/30 - 1/100\nVery Strong evidence for H1\n\n\n&lt;1/100\nExtreme evidence for H1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER,\n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  message = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault information: statistical details / Bayes factor / samples sizes / distribution summary\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English scores by race.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE,\n  pariwise.comparisons = TRUE,\n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.methods = \"fdr\",\n  message = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“na” -&gt; only non-significant\n“s” -&gt; only significant\n“all” -&gt; everything\n\n\n\n\nTestCISummary\n\n\nFollowing (between-subjects) tests are carried out for each type of analyses.\n\n\n\nTYPE\nNO.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favour of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favour of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favour of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes factor is often written as B10. It can be defined mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\frac{likelihood-of-data-given-H_1}{likelihood-of-data-given-H_0} = \\frac{P(D|H_1)}{P(D/H_0)}\n\\]\nThe Schwarz criterion is one of the easiest ways to calculate rough estimation of the Bayes factor.\n\n\n\n\nA Bayes Factor can be any positive number.\nOne of the most common interpretation is this one - first proposed by Harold Jeffereys (1961) and slightly modified by Lee and Wagemakers in 2013.\n\nBayes Factor\n\n\nIF B10 IS…\nTHEN YOU HAVE\n\n\n\n\n&gt;100\nExtreme evidence for H1\n\n\n30 - 100\nVery strong evidence for H1\n\n\n10 - 30\nStrong evidence for H1\n\n\n3 - 10\nModerate evidence for H1\n\n\n1 - 3\nAnecdotal evidence for H1\n\n\n1\nNo evidence\n\n\n1/3 - 1\nAnecdotal evidence for H1\n\n\n1/3 - 1/10\nModerate evidence for H1\n\n\n1/10 - 1/30\nStrong evidence for H1\n\n\n1/30 - 1/100\nVery Strong evidence for H1\n\n\n&lt;1/100\nExtreme evidence for H1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER,\n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  message = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault information: statistical details / Bayes factor / samples sizes / distribution summary\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English scores by race.\n\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE,\n  pariwise.comparisons = TRUE,\n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.methods = \"fdr\",\n  message = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“na” -&gt; only non-significant\n“s” -&gt; only significant\n“all” -&gt; everything\n\n\n\n\nTestCISummary\n\n\nFollowing (between-subjects) tests are carried out for each type of analyses.\n\n\n\nTYPE\nNO.
